# golang csv - json file converter v1.0
This application converts csv files to json formatted files.

In this version of the application I declared csv file manually in the code. So if you want to use this application ,for now, you need to add your csv file to the folder and write the name of the csv file in the code. 

It automatically uses the flights.csv file. However if the user can define a file. 

"go run app.go -path='filepath'"
